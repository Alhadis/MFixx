MFixx: Fixed MFizz icons
========================

This is an optimised version of the [MFizz icon font](https://github.com/fizzed/font-mfizz/) produced for the [File-Icons package](https://github.com/DanBrooker/file-icons).
Enhancements include:

 * Normalised fitting and alignment
 
 * Removal of excess geometry to improve filesize

No visible details have been modified.  Credit for these icons belongs to [Fizzed](http://fizzed.com/) and the [Mfizz project's various contributors](https://github.com/fizzed/font-mfizz/graphs/contributors).

For an extended explanation on how the font's been optimised, consult the notes of [another font](https://github.com/Alhadis/DevOpicons) that was patched for the File-Icons package.
